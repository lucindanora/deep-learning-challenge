# deep-learning-challenge

## **Background**
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 
With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can 
predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

A deep learning model was used to predict the success of the Alphabet Soup funded organizations. Alphbet Soup has provided a CSV containing more tha 34,000 organizations that have previously recieved finding. Using Gogle Colab the following steps were followed:

1. Preprocessing the Data
2. Complie, Train and Evaluate the Model
3. Optomize the Model
4. Write a Report
